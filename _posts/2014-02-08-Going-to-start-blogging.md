So I've decided I'm going to start blogging! Planning to get a post out once a week barring any crazy school work that pops up. Mostly will be about my projects, 
and other techy stuff I find cool. Once in a while I while I might throw in a rant about Manchester United, David Moyes or just life in general. Stay tuned!
